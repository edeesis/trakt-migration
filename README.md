Simple React App to that I wrote to save myself a bunch of clicks in the Trakt UI and to save my hand from pain.

It probably took way longer to write this than it would've taken me to do it manually.

It's not pretty, but it works pretty well. (Disclaimer: it worked when I did it before I changed a bunch of stuff and haven't tested since).

### Start up

Run `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
